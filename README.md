About me: 

I am a beginner software tester. I want to softly change my job and smoothly start doing new ones
duties. I completed postgraduate studies at the University of Information Technology and Management (UITM) in Rzesz√≥w. I also learn from all available sources such as Udemy, Youtube, books, articles and websites for testers. I consider all comments to my work very valuable and thank you in advance.
